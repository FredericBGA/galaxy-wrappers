**Overview**

This program identifies markers genotyping errors recorded in a table file based on their order (obtained from genetic map or reference sequence) provided in a table file.

This program is based on the principle that no more than one recombination event can occur in a window of x around the observed marker (x is passed in --fen argument).

If more than one recombination event is observed, a genotyping error is identified.

This program output three files:

* A file containing corrected markers (--nosu argument)

* A file containing corrected markers where redundancy is removed (--nr argument)

* A file where markers with more than X errors are identified are removed. (--Nosu argument)

This program works on phased markers of same type. It is based on the principle that no more than one recombination can be observed in a window around each markers.


For example, the value 10=3 passed in --fen argument indicates that only markers located on scaffolds containing 10 or more markers will be corrected/genotyping error will be identified. An error will be identified if more than 1 recombination event is observed in a window size of [-3 ; +3] markers around the observed markers.

The 20 value passed in --suspect arguments indicate all markers having at least 20 errors detected are discarded from the output file.

This file contained filtered markers but the genotyping errors in this file have not been corrected.
