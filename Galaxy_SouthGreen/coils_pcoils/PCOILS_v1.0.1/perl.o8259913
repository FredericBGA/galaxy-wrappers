PCoils window size is 21
52 sequences extracted from temp_files/alignhits_input and written to temp_files/alignhits_output.psi
Reformatted temp_files/alignhits_output.psi with 52 sequences from psi to a3m and written to file temp_files/hhfilter_input.a3m
Input file = temp_files/hhfilter_input.a3m
Output file = temp_files/hhfilter_output.a3m
Read temp_files/hhfilter_input.a3m with 52 sequences
Alignment in temp_files/hhfilter_input.a3m contains 1210 match states
1 out of 52 sequences passed filter (20% min coverage, 40% min sequence identity to query, 90% max pairwise sequence identity)
Writing A3M alignment to temp_files/hhfilter_output.a3m
Done
Reformatted temp_files/hhfilter_output.a3m with 1 sequence from a3m to fas and written to file temp_files/hhfilter_output.fas
Read in temp_files/hhfilter_output.a3m with 1 sequences
Alignment in temp_files/hhfilter_output.a3m contains 1210 match states
1 out of 1 sequences passed filter for 90% maximum sequence identity, 20%, minimum coverage, and 0% minimum sequence identity to query
Effective number of sequences exp(entropy) = 1.0
