---PCOILS on the Web---

See ftp://ftp.tuebingen.mpg.de/pub/protevo/PCOILS/


---Preparation / Installation---

Generate Executables

In the folder Documentation, you can find the descriptions (README
files) how to generate following executables (you can use the commands
in brackets below):
- PCoils_core (source Documentation/PCoils_core.README)
- run_coils (source Documentation/run_coils.README)
- run_play_without_window_max (source Documentation/run_play_without_window_max.README)

Folders

For this tool, there are some folder dependencies.
- Following folders (although they are empty) have to stay inside the
  PCOILS directory: dummy, temp_files
- You have to create a new folder called 'blast' inside the PCOILS
  directory which includes the BLAST software or you have to set a
  symbolic link to the directory where you have BLAST. If you set a symbolic
  link, it has to be called blast.

---Preparation---

Additionally to the sourcecode you downloaded, you need to include the blast software (64 Bit).
It has to be included as symbolic link within the PCOILS directory.

1) Download and install the 64 Bit Blast Version from NCBI:
   Server: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/release/LATEST/
   Blast Version: blast-2.2.23-x64-linux.tar.gz

2) Copy the executables (blastall, etc., but especially blastall) inside blast from the /bin directory 
   directly into the /blast directory.

3) Set a symbolic link to Blast:
   cd {into the PCoils directory}
   ln -s {path to the blast directory} blast

IMPORTANT: Use the 64 Bit Version of Blast!

---Usage---

perl PCoils.pl <input_file> <database>


---Input File---

Any single sequence or multiple sequence alignment in FASTA format is
possible.
An input example file is included (PCoils.input).


---Database---

The database is ideally the NR90 filtered by Pfilt with the -c option
(leaving the coiled-coil regions unfiltered).
For PCoils the NCBI databases are used (Link to the databases:
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA/nr.gz). An older version (from
March 2008) to download is available at
ftp://ftp.tuebingen.mpg.de/pub/protevo/old
!!! You need to specify the database with its absolute path. !!!


---Output File---

The output file is written into the actual folder, where also the PCoils
sourcecode can be found.


---Content---

Following sourcecode is included in this folder:

- PCoils.pl: main PCOILS script (it needs the executable PCoils_core
  that is compiled according to PCoils_core.README)
- PCoils_core: is called by PCoils.pl (also see PCoils_core.README)
- alignhits.pl: written by Johannes Soeding
- get_logarithmic_profile.c: tool that converts a non-log COILS matrix
  into one in log space
- hhfilter: executable by Johannes Soeding
- hhmake: executable by Johannes Soeding
- manipulate_pdbaa.pl: puts sequences in one line per sequence
- myhmmmake_PCoils.pl: called by PCoils.pl
- ncoils.h: COILS header file
- ncoils_play_without_window_maximization.c: version of Coils that only
  gives the scores as output
- ncoils_profile.c: modified COILS code (PCOILS)
- ncoils_profile.h: belongs to modified COILS code (PCOILS)
- ncoils_public.c: COILS code
- new.mat: MTIDK matrix in log format
- old.mat: MTK matrix in log format
- pdb_matrix_log: PDB matrix in log format
- read_log_matrix_public.c: belongs to modified COILS code (reads matrix
- in log format)
- score988.11_log: iterated matrix in log format (it converged after 11
  iterations with a probability cutoff of 98.8%)
